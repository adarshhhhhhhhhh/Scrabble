# Scrabble
In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
1	3	3	2	1	4	2	4	1	8	5	1	3	1	1	3	10	1	1	1	1	4	4	8	4	10
For example, if we wanted to score the word “CODE”, we would note that the ‘C’ is worth 3 points, the ‘O’ is worth 1 point, the ‘D’ is worth 2 points, and the ‘E’ is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that “CODE” is worth 7 points.
